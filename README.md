# Digital NFT Minting Platform

## Project Title
Digital NFT Minting Platform for Digital Art

## Project Description
This project implements a streamlined NFT (Non-Fungible Token) minting platform on the Ethereum blockchain focused specifically on digital art. The platform allows artists to easily tokenize their digital creations as unique assets on the blockchain with just a few simple steps.

Built on the ERC-721 standard, the platform provides artists with essential tools to mint, manage and potentially monetize their digital artwork. Each NFT contains metadata pointing to the digital artwork and preserves creator attribution permanently on the blockchain. The platform includes a basic royalty mechanism that ensures artists receive a percentage of secondary sales, providing ongoing revenue streams for creators.

This smart contract serves as the core infrastructure for a complete NFT marketplace ecosystem, handling the critical functions of token minting, creator attribution, and royalty management. The platform balances simplicity with powerful features, making it accessible to artists new to blockchain technology while still providing the functionality needed by experienced creators.

## Project Vision
The vision for this NFT minting platform is to democratize access to the digital art market by providing creators with a simple yet powerful way to tokenize and potentially monetize their work. By reducing technical barriers and simplifying the minting process, we aim to empower artists of all backgrounds to participate in the growing NFT ecosystem.

Our platform addresses key challenges in the traditional art market: attribution, provenance, royalties, and global reach. Through blockchain technology, artists can establish verifiable provenance for their work, receive proper attribution, earn royalties from secondary sales, and reach a global audience without geographical limitations.

The ultimate goal is to create a more equitable digital art ecosystem where creators maintain greater control over their work and receive fair compensation for their creative contributions, all while connecting with collectors and enthusiasts around the world.
